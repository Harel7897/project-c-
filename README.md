## About the app:
Video processing application using C++ The application accepts a video file as input and performs a variety of processing operations on it 

## What I learned from this project:
I learned to deal with tools I don't know under times I didn't use GStremear because it caused me problems and its installation crashed my computer several times so I decided to submit without GStremear, with God's help I will be able to understand the problem causing this
